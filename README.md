# Tales of Polish Wrestling

This is a project to write down and preserve the history of Polish Pro Wrestling.
Currently, this history is spread across many sites: news portals, blogs, forums, other wiki sites similar to this, video sites; and Cagematch.
But due to the nature of the (free) web, a lof of this content is no longer accessible, or degraded. TPW wants to have all wrestling shows that happened in Poland (and none other), backyards included. TPW wants to have bios on all wrestlers that appeared in Poland, local or foreign. TPW wants to preserve media that may fall of the face of the internet - photos and videos of these events.

The official, Polish name for this project is "Teczki Polskiego Wrestlingu", which is more like _The Secret Files of Polish Wrestling_. But I decided to stick with Tales, to keep the acronym consistent.

## Goals

#### Resilient

* Simple file-based structure
* No database to break
* Anyone can fork and continue the project
* No public open forms to spam
* Stable links that never break

#### Collaborative

* Lives in a public repository (the one you're reading right now)
* Accepts contributions
* Permissively licensed

#### Future-proof

* Builds in seconds with reliable software
* Can publish anywhere - just a directory of files
* Text-based formats, easily parsed

#### Useful for everyone

* In English, the universal language of pro wrestling
* Accessible, using modern web standards

#### Better than Cagematch

While Cagematch is a great resource, it can take a long time to accept a lesser known promotion, or a new wrestler fresh out of the backyard. It also does too much - wants to have all the world's wrestling, allows reviews. It also does too little - just a match list, basic info and social links (which often degrade), but has no place for bios and articles.

#### More focused than Wikipedia

Wikipedia's notability standards would result in deleting a lot of content that TPW cares about. Their governance structure is notoriously fickle and impenetrable, and undeleting content can take years.

## Non-goals

TPW doesn't want to be a forum (although GitHub provides something similar with its Discussions feature).
TPW doesn't want to be a review site or a news site (but it wants to have upcoming events too).
TPW doesn't want to be a photo sharing site - although it wants your wrestler photos as illustrations.
TPW doesn't cover events that happened outside of Poland.

## Collaborating

If you're familiar with GitHub, the preferred workflow is to create branches and pull requests. If you're not, submitting issues with corrections to existing pages, or with new content is also accepted. Create an account on GitHub and come help!

See `GUIDELINES.md` for how we write, and what we don't want to write. See `CARD.md` to understand the match card blocks in event articles.
