#### Recap

* The main event featured an accidental ref bump by Hunter. With the referee out of action, chairs were introduced to the ring, and after dropping Revage through them, Hunter pinned and counted to three himself.
  The match continued, and Revage landed a diving stomp just as the referee was back on his feet, and won by pinfall.
* After the main event, Malmo and Pain Killer congratulated the winner, and entered the ring to attack Hunter. Encouraged by the audience, Revage ran back into the ring.
  This is the only shot in the whole video that we see the audience. Initially allowing Hunter to take a chairshot to the head, he superkicked Malmo and then Painkiller, who was held over the shoulder of Hunter. The two opponents shook hands to close the show.
