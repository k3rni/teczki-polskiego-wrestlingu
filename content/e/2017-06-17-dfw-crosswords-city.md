Crosswords City by [Dream Factory Wrestling](@/o/dfw.md) was a sideshow accompanying a local festival, Firemen's Picnic in Krzyżówki, which took place on Saturday, June 17, 2017. Krzyżówki is a village about 20km north of Włocławek, in the Kuyavia-Pomerania region of Poland. The event was held outdoors, on the village's sports and events grounds neighboring the local Fire brigade's location.

The event's name refers to the village name: Krzyżówki can be translated both as _crossroads_, and _crosswords_.
