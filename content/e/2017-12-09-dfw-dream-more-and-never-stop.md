#### Recap

* Painkiller entered through the window, jumping down onto the ring. Another masked wrestler intervened in their fight, but since it was a No DQ match, this had no consequences. \\
  Later in their fight, PJ Blake removed Painkiller's mask. After recovering and putting it back on, he won with a frog splash.
* Direk was the first one to score a pin. Later Norris took a daring jump from the same spot that Painkiller jumped into the ring.
