#### Recap

* Corin Mear's bodypaint was inspired by the main character Aang from "Avatar the Last Airbender" animated series
* Norris was supposed to face Malmo one on one. However, Hekate came out with a microphone and turned the fight into a tag team match, if Norris was able to find a partner. Corin Mear volunteered himself, and the match started.
* When Hekate was tagged in, she requested to tag in Corin Mear. Who then proceeded to announce that if he's fighting barechested, then she should remove her T-shirt as well. She obliged, revealing her usual gear underneath.
* In his recorded promo, PJ Blake issues a challenge to What Is Wrestling, who are wrestling content creators Seth Donner and Amisz. He calls them keyboard warriors, who know nothing about the sport besides what they see on TV. Initially, Donner responds, telling PJ that he's going to face his toughest opponent yet, but at the last moment he names the diminutive Amisz as his opponent. The match is a David vs Goliath comedy spotfest, with Amisz trying various ways to overcome Blake.
