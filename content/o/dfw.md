Dream Factory Wrestling was a short-lived wrestling organization from Toruń, estabilished in 2015. Widely considered to be just another backyard,
nevertheless they managed to hold multiple showcases and events in 2016, before fizzling out at the end of 2017. DFW never had a proper, experienced trainer. Unlike other backyard organizations, they did not do any sort of ultraviolent matches, but dabbled in hardcore wrestling, as there were several Street Fight matches, with kendo sticks, chairs, ladders and Legos.

### History

#### Before 2015: Local backyard

Dream Factory Wrestling came to be as a result of two backyard organizations merging. These were: TWF from Toruń, and BGW from Grudziądz. The first one started in 2011, and had some presence on the wrestling forums at the time. Facebook still has some relics of their [fanpage](https://www.facebook.com/TorunWrestlingFederation/), but none of their videos are available anymore.

BGW is more obscure, and probably had no online presence.

#### 2015: First shows

The new organization named itself after its members' shared dream - to be a wrestler. Hence, Dream Factory. In May 2015, Chris Hunter posted about getting their own ring, and holding a total of 10 training sessions before their [first show](@/e/dfw/2015-06-20-dfw-showcase.md) in June that year.

#### 2016: Peak year

DFW held 10 shows in 2016, some of them either sideshows to community festivals in smaller cities around Toruń. Others were held at various local highschools, often to an indifferent audience. In June, [Norris](@/w/isnorr.md) joined their roster, appearing on every event since then. [Rob Scaffold](@/w/rob-scaffold.md) appears in August, then Faust in November - all coming from backyard-era [PpW](@/o/ppw.md).

#### 2017: Slower but bigger, MZW exits

The next year had only 6 shows, some of them with 5 matches on the card (as opposed to the previous years, where 3 matches were typical). DFW gained its first female wrestler, who debuted in the ring on their [Valentine's day show](@/e/dfw/2017-02-14-dfw-love-hurts-wrestling-even-more.md). More characters from the Polish scene appear: PpW's Steven Strong at that same show, later joined by [Cade Bruce](@/w/mister-z.md).

However, later in the year, two important characters left, to later appear in [MZW](@/o/mzw.md) - those were [Charlie](@/w/madman-charlie.md) and [Revage](@/w/rafael-kid.md), DFW Champion at the time. On October 29th, Hunter posts about the organization suspending its activity.

#### 2018: Final shows

Despite the suspension, there were two more, short events held in 2018. One a gauntlet match for the vacant championship, the other with just two matches as a sideshow to a community festival.

### Scene relations

DFW had neither the budget nor the status for any sort of foreign guests, and they had none. On the Polish scene, they were cooperating with PpW, with some of their talent, notably Charlie and [Direk](@/w/direk.md) appearing at PpW's backyard-era events. At [Recent Dreams](@/e/dfw/2017-04-23-dfw-recent-dreams.md), PJ Blake had a comedy match against [Amisz](@/w/axel-fox.md), at that time merely an internet personality, still to make his [debut for MZW](@/e/mzw/2017-12-02-mzw-freak-show.md) later that year. They also returned to the newer, more professional PpW after 2019.

### Championships

DFW had one singles championship, introduced and crowned at the first (and only) [Tournament of Dreams](@/e/dfw/2016-08-20-dfw-tournament-of-dreams-2.md). The inaugural champion was [Chris Hunter](@/w/chris-hunter.md), and the final person to hold the belt was Norris.

Norris brought the belt to PpW, although it was never defended there. At some point, the belt's faceplate was damaged, showing a large fracture line down the middle. The plate was also removed from the leather strap, which was reused for another belt.
