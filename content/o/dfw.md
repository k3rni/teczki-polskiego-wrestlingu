Dream Factory Wrestling was a wrestling organization from Toru≈Ñ. Considered by some on the forums to be just another backyard,
nevertheless they managed to hold multiple showcases and events in 2016, before fizzling out at the end of 2017. Some of their wrestlers continued to appear on the Polish scene, mainly by joining [Maniac Zone Wrestling](@/o/mzw.md).

During their existence, DFW wrestlers [Charlie](@/w/madman-charlie.md) and [Direk](@/w/direk.md) appeared on [PpW's](@/o/ppw.md) early events in 2016. Conversely, [Rob Scaffold](@/w/rob-scaffold.md), [Cade Bruce](@/w/mister-z.md) competed for DFW a number of times. After 2019, with DFW defunct, Charlie and Direk also appeared several times for the new, more professional PpW. This is an early and rare example of the Polish wrestling scene cooperating between organizations.
