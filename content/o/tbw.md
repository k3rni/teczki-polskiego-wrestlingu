Total Blast Wrestling was a short-lived organization, that held only two events before disappearing. It was created by Andrzej Supron and Paweł Borkowski,
after they split from [Do or Die Wrestling](@/o/ddw.md) due to its poor ticket sales and no funds to invite bigger wrestling stars.

### History

#### 2007: PPWF

#### 2009: split from DDW, first event

The newly created DDW had ambitious plans, which included holding an event in Warsaw's Stodoła klub. However, tickets prices for this event proved to be too high
and the interest in wrestling too low, ultimately leading to its cancellation. After that, Supron and Borkowski ended their collaboration with DDW, and set off with their own plan.

According to them, basing the events on only Polish wrestlers, at that time few and unknown, did not make sense. Neither did they want to organize a wrestling school to train their own stars first. And lastly, that they cannot afford hiring the best-known American superstars, when the European independent scene will suffice. Thus did Borkowski and Supon contact Bernard Van Damme, a Belgian wrestler and promotor. Van Damme's organization Eurostars, was holding events in Belgium and France at that time, and had a solid roster of experienced, if unknown to Polish fans, wrestlers. With Bernard's help, they also contacted Fight Club Finland, European Wrestling Association from Austria, the German Wrestling Federation.

Supron, who financed the new organization's ring himself, chose the name Total Blast Wrestling. The duo soon announced their first event, to be held on February 2010 in Radom.
From the get go, they put in serious effort and money. The event was to be held in a proper sports venue, with professional lightning and sound. Extreme Sports Channel, which the duo worked for as Polish-language wrestling commentators, was to re-broadcast the event in several episodes. To promote their event, they appeared on TV, including the popular breakfast-TV program "Dzień Dobry TVN", with Van Damme and Cybernic Machine.
